# This script builds and pushes the ACS Fleet Manager tools container image which is used by CI pipelines.
# In order to work, it needs the following variables defined in the CI/CD configuration of the project:
#
# QUAY_USER - The name of the robot account used to push images to
# 'quay.io', for example 'openshift-unified-hybrid-cloud+jenkins'.
#
# QUAY_TOKEN - The token of the robot account used to push images to
# 'quay.io'.
#
# The machines that run this script need to have access to internet, so that
# the built images can be pushed to quay.io.
# =====================================================================================================================

# Set image repository to default value if it is not passed via env
IMAGE_REPOSITORY="${QUAY_IMAGE_REPOSITORY:-rhacs-eng/fleet-manager-tools}"

source ./scripts/build_setup.sh

# Push the image:
echo "Quay.io user and token is set, will push images to $IMAGE_REPOSITORY"
